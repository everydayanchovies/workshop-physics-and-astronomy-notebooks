The structural, thermodynamic, and mechanical stabilities of MgSiO 3 , MgGeO 3 and MgSnO 3 are confirmed by tolerance factor (0.93–1.0 the stability range for cubic structure), enthalpy of formation, and Born mechanical stability criteria, respectively. The ductile nature of studied materials has been explored by Pugh's (B/G > 1.75) and Poisson (υ > 0.26) ratios. The studied compounds are indirect bandgap semiconductors having band gap range 2.5 eV to 0.7 eV and, correspondingly, their thermoelectric properties are modified. The small values of σ/κ ratio and large values ZT (0.57, 0.66, and 0.67) at room temperature make them suitable for thermoelectric applications.},

   abstract = {The phase stability, electronic structure and mechanical properties of MoSi 2 at different phases were systematically investigated by first-principles density functional theory calculations. The results indicated that both tetragonal and hexagonal MoSi 2 are thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The formation energy of the hexagonal phase is 6.27 kJ mol −1 smaller than that of the tetragonal one. In tetragonal MoSi 2 , Mo 4d xz , 4d yz and 4d 2 z orbitals overlap effectively with Si sp 1 z , p x and p y ones, while interactions between Mo 4d x 2 −y 2 (4d xy) and Si 2p orbitals are confirmed in the hexagonal phase. However, the bond strengths of the hexagonal phase are smaller, leading to changes in the mechanical properties. Young's modulus decreases from 443.33 to 341.37 GPa as the phase transforms from the tetragonal to the hexagonal phase. The weakness of the Si-Mo bonds along the [0 0 1] direction and the Si-Si bonds within the (0 0 1) plane make the shear deformations of the hexagonal phase much easier to occur, and the G/B ratio correspondingly decreases, suggesting improvement in ductility. Moreover, the calculated Vicker's hardness of the hexagonal phase is 10.15 GPa, 48% smaller than the value in the tetragonal one. Besides the structural transformation, the external pressure can also affect the mechanical properties of the system. Different from the structural change, the external pressure enhances the Si-Si interactions while it reduces the Si-Mo (II) bond populations. Both the Vicker's hardness and ductility are improved as the hydrostatic pressure increases. The present calculations confirmed that the Si-Si (I) interactions play a central role in the hardness and ductility of MoSi 2 materials.},

   abstract = {Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) is an interesting material for high-temperature applications. It has a high melting temperature, good thermal and electrical conductivity and an excellent oxidation resistance. For many years the primary use of MoSi2 has been in heating elements, which can be used for temperatures up to 1800°C. Since the 1990s the potential of MoSi2 as a high-temperature structural material has been recognized as well. Its brittleness at lower temperatures and a poor creep resistance above 1200°C have hindered its use as in load-bearing parts. These disadvantages may be offset at least partly by using it together with a second material in a composite or an alloy. Projected applications of MoSi2-based materials include, e.g. stationary hot section components in gas turbine engines and glow plugs in diesel engines. For future research and development directions of MoSi2-based composites diffusion is a crucial property because creep is closely connected with diffusion. This paper is devoted to the basic diffusion and defect properties of MoSi2. Data of Si and Mo as well as Ge diffusion from the Münster laboratory for both principal directions are briefly summarized. For all three kinds of atoms diffusion perpendicular to the tetragonal axis is faster than parallel to it. The diffusivities of Mo in both directions are many orders of magnitude slower than those of Si and Ge. The huge asymmetry between Mo and Si (or Ge) diffusion suggests that atomic motion of each constituent is restricted to its own sublattice. Positron annihilation studies on MoSi2 from the Stuttgart laboratory are reviewed as well. They show that formation of thermal vacancies occurs primarily on the Si sublattice but cannot exclude vacancy formation on the Mo sublattice at higher temperatures. Correlation factors for Si and Mo diffusion via sublattice vacancies in the respective sublattices of MoSi 2 have been calculated recently mainly by Monte Carlo simulation techniques and are also briefly described. Diffusion, in particular self-diffusion, is discussed in connection with literature data on high-temperature creep, which is diffusion-controlled. Grain-size effects of creep have been reported and can be attributed to Nabarro-Herring and Coble creep. Power-law creep is attributed to diffusion-controlled dislocation creep. Some details are, however, not completely understood, presumably due to a lack of theoretical concepts for creep in uniaxial, stochiometric compounds and due to missing information on grain-boundary diffusion. © 2012 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

An effect of forward correlation of tracer atom jumps in the silicon sublattice with the corresponding partial correlation factor of 1.5 appears at small frequencies of silicon atom jumps along the tetragonal axis with respect to the jump frequencies in the silicon layer perpendicular to the tetragonal axis of the MoSi2 structure.

   abstract = {A novel 2D semiconductor, MoSi2N4 monolayer, was very recently successfully fabricated and shown great potential for future broad applications in nanoelectronic devices and catalysis. For the synthesis and application of the material, intrinsic point defects are required to be considered, because they are inevitably formed during the bottom-up synthesis and following substrate transfer process, and also can be intentionally introduced by defect engineering to modulate properties and explore applications of materials. Herein, eight types of intrinsic point defects including two vacancies (N mono- and di-vacancies; VN(m) and VN2(m)), four antisites (SiMo, SiN(t), MoN(m) and MoSi) and two adatoms (Siada and Nada) are found to have highly thermodynamic stabilities in MoSi2N4 monolayer under various chemical environments. Electronic properties calculations suggest the existence of VN(m) and VN2(m) leads to the emergence of the recombination center, reducing the carrier lifetime and thus showing the potential for high-speed switching device applications. SiN(t) and Siada-defected structures show p-type and n-type conducting characters, respectively, which can be explored for possible PN junction applications. Also, the existence of MoSi may induce unusual resistance–temperature dependence behavior, providing some chances to design high-mobility semiconductors. Combined with the migration behavior of point defects (monovacancies and adatoms), the Schottky defect formation mechanism of VN(m) could be reasonably explained. Besides, high migration barriers of monovacancy defects (VN(m), VSi and VMo) demonstrate their higher kinetic stability in monolayer, compared with monovacancies in graphene and silicene. The migration of N adatom is relatively difficult than that of Si adatom, increasing opportunities to detect it in experiments. This work will provide insight into defect engineering of MoSi2N4 monolayer and the MA2Z4 monolayer family for various applications.},

Low thermal conductivity enables thermoelectric materials better thermal conversion performance. In this study, based on the first principles and phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we studied the thermal conductivities of single-layer WSe2 under several defect conditions using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The lattice thermal conductivities of WSe2 under six kinds of defect states, i.e., PS, SS-c, DS-s, SW-c, SS-e, and DS-d, are 66.1, 41.2, 39.4, 8.8, 42.1, and 38.4 W/(m·K), respectively at 300 K. Defect structures can reduce thermal conductivity up to 86.7 percent (SW-c) compared with perfect structure. The influences of defect content, type, location factors on thermal properties have been discussed in this research. By introducing atom defects, we can reduce and regulate the thermal property of WSe2, which should provide an interesting idea for other thermoelectric materials to gain a lower thermal conductivity.},

Silicide-based thermoelectrics are examples of cost-efficient and environmentally friendly new energy materials, which can be used for power-generation applications in the range of 500–800 K. We review the research focusing on the exploration of n-type Mg2IV-based solid solutions (IV = Si, Ge and Sn) and summarize the most prominent discoveries achieved so far in their studies. Owing to their superior performance compared to other silicides, including p-type Mg2IV, higher manganese silicides (HMS) are commonly considered as a suitable p-type material to be used in thermoelectric modules in conjunction with n-type Mg2IV-based solid solutions for mid-temperature power-generation applications. We describe the strategies used to improve the thermal and electronic transport properties of n-type Mg2IV-based solid solutions and mention some key features of HMS. We also point out the importance of mechanical properties and thermal stability of this family of materials and offer perspectives on the future research work to further improve their performance.},

abstract = {Molybdenum, a trace element essential for micro-organisms, plants, and animals, was discovered in 1778 by a Swedish chemist named Karl Scheele. Initially mistaken for lead, molybdenum was named after the Greek work molybdos, meaning lead-like. In the 1930s, it was recognized that ingestion of forage with high amounts of molybdenum by cattle caused a debilitating condition. In the 1950s, the essentiality of molybdenum was established with the discovery of the first molybdenum-containing enzymes. In humans, only 4 enzymes requiring molybdenum have been identified to date: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component (mARC). Sulfite oxidase, an enzyme found in mitochondria, catalyzes oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, the final step in oxidation of sulfur amino acids (cysteine and methionine). Xanthine oxidase converts hypoxanthine to xanthine, and further converts xanthine to uric acid, preventing hypoxanthine, formed from spontaneous deamination of adenine, from leading to DNA mutations if paired with cytosine in place of thymine. Aldehyde oxidase is abundant in the liver and is an important enzyme in phase 1 drug metabolism. Finally, mARC, discovered less than a decade ago, works in concert with cytochrome b5 type B and NAD(H) cytochrome b5 reductase to reduce a variety of N-hydroxylated substrates, although the physiologic significance is still unclear. In the case of each of the molybdenum enzymes, activity is catalyzed via a tricyclic cofactor composed of a pterin, a dithiolene, and a pyran ring, called molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) (1).}

An algorithm, for any crystal, to derive a unique description of the crystal structure together with a recommended band path is indispensable for this task. The electronic band structure is typically sampled along a path within the first Brillouin zone including the surface in reciprocal space. Some points in reciprocal space have higher site symmetries and/or have higher constraints than other points regarding the electronic band structure and therefore are likely to be more important than other points. This work categorizes points in reciprocal space according to their symmetry and provides recommended band paths that cover all special wavevector (k-vector) points and lines necessarily and sufficiently. Points in reciprocal space are labeled such that there is no conflict with the crystallographic convention. The k-vector coefficients of labeled points, which are located at Brillouin zone face and edge centers as well as vertices, are derived based on a primitive cell compatible with the crystallographic convention, including those with axial ratio-dependent coordinates. Furthermore, we provide an open-source implementation of the algorithms within our SeeK-path python code, to allow researchers to obtain k-vector coefficients and recommended band paths in an automated fashion.

Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.}

Isosurfaces can be colored according to other physical quantities. Translucent isosurfaces and/or slices can be overlapped with a structural model. Collaboration with external programs enables the user to locate bonds and bond angles in the `graphics area', simulate powder diffraction patterns, and calculate site potentials and Madelung energies. Electron densities determined experimentally are convertible into their Laplacians and electronic energy densities.},

abstract = {Defects and defect engineering are at the core of many regimes of material research, including the field of thermoelectric study. The 60-year history of V2VI3 thermoelectric materials is a prime example of how a class of semiconductor material, considered mature several times, can be rejuvenated by better understanding and manipulation of defects. This review aims to provide a systematic account of the underexplored intrinsic point defects in V2VI3 compounds, with regard to (i) their formation and control, and (ii) their interplay with other types of defects towards higher thermoelectric performance. We herein present a convincing case that intrinsic point defects can be actively controlled by extrinsic doping and also via compositional, mechanical, and thermal control at various stages of material synthesis. An up-to-date understanding of intrinsic point defects in V2VI3 compounds is summarized in a (χ, r)-model and applied to elucidating the donor-like effect. These new insights not only enable more innovative defect engineering in other thermoelectric materials but also, in a broad context, contribute to rational defect design in advanced functional materials at large.},

abstract = {A novel 2D semiconductor, MoSi2N4 monolayer, was very recently successfully fabricated and shown great potential for future broad applications in nanoelectronic devices and catalysis. For the synthesis and application of the material, intrinsic point defects are required to be considered, because they are inevitably formed during the bottom-up synthesis and following substrate transfer process, and also can be intentionally introduced by defect engineering to modulate properties and explore applications of materials. Herein, eight types of intrinsic point defects including two vacancies (N mono- and di-vacancies; VN(m) and VN2(m)), four antisites (SiMo, SiN(t), MoN(m) and MoSi) and two adatoms (Siada and Nada) are found to have highly thermodynamic stabilities in MoSi2N4 monolayer under various chemical environments. Electronic properties calculations suggest the existence of VN(m) and VN2(m) leads to the emergence of the recombination center, reducing the carrier lifetime and thus showing the potential for high-speed switching device applications. SiN(t) and Siada-defected structures show p-type and n-type conducting characters, respectively, which can be explored for possible PN junction applications. Also, the existence of MoSi may induce unusual resistance–temperature dependence behavior, providing some chances to design high-mobility semiconductors. Combined with the migration behavior of point defects (monovacancies and adatoms), the Schottky defect formation mechanism of VN(m) could be reasonably explained. Besides, high migration barriers of monovacancy defects (VN(m), VSi and VMo) demonstrate their higher kinetic stability in monolayer, compared with monovacancies in graphene and silicene. The migration of N adatom is relatively difficult than that of Si adatom, increasing opportunities to detect it in experiments. This work will provide insight into defect engineering of MoSi2N4 monolayer and the MA2Z4 monolayer family for various applications.}

Unless measures are taken to reduce the use of primary molybdenum resources, the transition to a fossil-free energy world could be jeopardized. This study argues that the global use of primary molybdenum resources needs to be substantially reduced at short notice, if humanity wishes to take the interests of future generations into account. We investigated how this goal can be achieved. The study shows that the focus should be on increasing molybdenum recycling, because there is little or no substitution potential for molybdenum in its major applications. It will be necessary to increase the recycling rate of molybdenum from end-of-life products from the current rate of 20\% to more than 80\%. This ambitious goal can only be achieved by introducing a dedicated molybdenum waste collection, separation, and recycling system. It is highly uncertain that the free market price mechanism will work in time and sufficiently to preserve molybdenum resources for future generations.}

abstract = {In past centuries, men have mainly looked to increase their production of energy in order to develop their industry, means of transport and quality of life. Since the recent energy crisis, researchers and industrials have looked mainly to manage energy in a better way, especially by increasing energy system efficiency. This context explains the growing interest for thermoelectric generators. Today, thermoelectric generators allow lost thermal energy to be recovered, energy to be produced in extreme environments, electric power to be generated in remote areas and microsensors to be powered. Direct solar thermal energy can also be used to produce electricity. This review begins with the basic principles of thermoelectricity and a presentation of existing and future materials. Design and optimization of generators are addressed. Finally in this paper, we developed an exhaustive presentation of thermoelectric generation applications covering electricity generation in extreme environments, waste heat recovery in transport and industry, domestic production in developing and developed countries, micro-generation for sensors and microelectronics and solar thermoelectric generators. Many recent applications are presented, as well as the future applications which are currently being studied in research laboratories or in industry. The main purpose of this paper is to clearly demonstrate that, almost anywhere in industry or in domestic uses, it is worth checking whether a TEG can be added whenever heat is moving from a hot source to a cold source.}
